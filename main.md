== Blog? ==

No, this is not a blog. This is a throw back to the good ol' 90s when people had webpages. The content is not organized by date. It is organized by categories. Yes, that's right, I'm making an effort to curate the content and trying to make something that isn't a random stream of thought sorted by date and time.

Revolutionary? No, but it makes a hell of a lot more sense than blogging, in my humble opinion. The only advantage to blogging is an ability to monitor changes and progress over time. Its compelling, but does not fit for many types of content.
