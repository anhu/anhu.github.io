== Fulwear's Website

Please access the following link: https://www.fulwear.com/products/free-shipping4-cylinder-full-metal-car-engine-assembly-kit-model-toys-for-adults

In the case that it is no longer there, I have screen shots of that page:

In the second page note the image of parts that are to be assembled. 

Note that these two animations were also on the page:

These animiations suggest moving parts and electronics. 

== Getting The Product

I received a package from:

```
LOGISTIC
TONGT

I opened the package and this is what I saw:

Note the paint job!!

== Compare and Contrast

Here are some quotes from the web page and my response:

```
Enjoy DIY Assembly Fun: Included 325 piece in total. The difficulty level is 4.5 stars. You will enjoy the fun it brings to you.
```
There was 1 part. A chunk of plastic that was badly painted. 

```
Power: In order to make the product easy to operate and no harm to the product, use electric motor instead of traditional gasoline, lithium battery capacity 500MAH, running at full power for no less than 30 minutes.
```
Power for what? There are no moving parts!! IT IS JUST A CHUNK OF PAINTED PLASTIC.

```
Assembly time: about 4 hours
Assembly difficulty: 4.5 Star
Charging Voltage: DC 10V-20V
```

But there was nothing to assemble and no electrical components or wires. IT IS JUST A CHUNK OF PAINTED PLASTIC. 

```
Package Content: 

1x V4 Car Engine Kit (357pcs)
1x Charger
1x English User Manual
1x Metal Box
```

None of these were included. Of course there was no user manual.  IT IS JUST A CHUNK OF PAINTE
D PLASTIC.

== Paypal Complaint

I called paypal and demanded a refund. I recieved notification that the seller requested I return the item to the following address before I could get the refund:

```
义乌市志旋电子商务有限公司
Flat3,12/F,Favor Industrial Building 2-5 Kin Hong Street Kwai Chung, XIANGGANG 288236 CN
```

The following images are proof that I have sent it back to the seller as requested via the paypal system.

== Desired Resolution

I expect to be fully refunded $49.99 USD. I also expect to be compensated $26.44 CAD for the shipping expense to return it. After all it was at the seller's request. It is a pointless request as the value of the item isn't even worth the cost to ship it but I did it because that is what the seller requested.

I would also appreciate a small reward from paypal for going to the trouble outlining all these details.
