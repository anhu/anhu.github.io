= Anthony's Thoughts on Leadership =

Am I a leader? Well, what is a leader?  A person who leads.  Can you lead without having any followers?  The answer might be yes, but it would seem that a leader with no followers is something akin to an emperor with no clothes.  

So I feel that if I proclaim myself a leader, I am claiming that I have followers.  Declaring that I am a leader is akin to saying that the people I work with - collaborators, co-workers, and partners - are my followers.  That is something I will not do.  Only they can declare whom they follow.  I would not claim to to speak on their behalf. On the flip side of that coin, I am not saying I am not a leader.  If you want to know if I'm a leader, you should figure out what kind of traits makes a leader and interact with me to figure out if I have those traits.  

I enjoy helping people reach their goals.  In order to get them to that goal, I will "do stuff".  I am a do-er.  I will think of the best way to achieve a given goal and set myself on a path to get to that goal.  If someone asks me if something is possible, I set forth and do it to show that it is possible.  If you want to get something done, give me a shout.  You can get in contact with me via LinkedIn.
